            <h4> <span style= "background-color: #e7e3ee"> Context </span> </h4>
            <p>The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about (in this specific situation) taking real problems and aiming to make something with code to 'solve' or help solve this issue. The purpose of this blog is to walk through the complete process of making my specific Freedom Project product, documenting the journey of the idea and brainstorming to the final working product.</p>
            <h4> <span style= "background-color: #e7e3ee"> Content </span> </h4>
            <p>For my project, I am making a book organizer app (dubbed Book Nook / Worm). This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Google App Scripts in order to make this application / automator.</p>

                    <p> Overall, my main takeaway on this project have to do more with my work ethics. Meaning, I learned to always keep all my notes in the same place, because I would come across problems in my code and then I'd have a hard time finding the solution because I have it probably written in a random document that I now lost. I also found myself rushing many times to meet certain goals because I didn't plan my time properly, which I think I need to do in any other future project. As for challenges, aside from the onces mentioned, I also had a lot happen with my code. Despite the warnings throughout the whole school year on how we only needed an MVP, I was ambituous and decided to do a lot at once, which only lead me to multiple mistakes. Since they were also all at the same time, it was a situation where I'd have to sit there and one by one check and see which mistake is the error, and sometimes when I would fix one, another would break. Since that was my only main issue, once it was resolved, I ws actually abnle to make my project, although it is very simple and can only accomplish one task, adding things to a spreadhseet. For my next steps, I plan on adding a function where the user can make and/or edit their own spreadhseet without going through the trouble of linking, making my project much more user interactive. Also, I'd like to add more functions to where the user can also edit, delete, and move information. </p>
